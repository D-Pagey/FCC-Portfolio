# FCC-Portfolio

This is another Free Code Camp basic Front End Project to create a simple portfolio page. 

I had it working well on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/xLyeNz) but when I took it locally the projects werent aligned properly.

I plan to create my own portfolio from scratch so I'm not too worried about making this particular project pixel perfect.
