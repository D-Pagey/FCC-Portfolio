## Personal Portfolio -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. I can click different buttons that will take me to different social media pages.
3. I can see thumbnail images of different projects.
4. I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

In this project I only used Bootstrap and CSS. Since it was a "basic" project (and I knew I would eventually make my own portfolio) I wanted to fulfil the user stories rather than do everything natively.

If I had more time, or on my actual portfolio, I would like to move away from Bootstrap and focus on utilising FlexBox.
