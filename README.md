## Personal Portfolio -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**

- [x] I can see thumbnail images of different projects.
- [x] I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

This is my 2nd project for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I initially completed it
 in Bootstrap and later refactored it to native CSS with Flexbox. I've also added
  a modal to display the user stories.

The CSS isn't mobile-first and not using SCSS. I would like to change this but also
don't want to endlessly refactor my "Basic" projects. I will save the iterative
refactoring for my real portfolio which is based off this project.
