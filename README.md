## Personal Portfolio -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
- [x] I can click different buttons that will take me to different social media pages.
- [x] I can see thumbnail images of different projects.
- [x] I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

This is my 2nd project for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The most recent version of this project was written in React using Create-React-App. In the past, I have made versions of this project in Bootstrap and then pure HTML and CSS, using Flexbox.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla JS version but not in the React version.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/xLyeNz) project on CodePen.
