## Personal Portfolio -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. I can click different buttons that will take me to different social media pages.
3. I can see thumbnail images of different projects.
4. I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

I first completed this project using Bootstrap and have recently refactored the CSS using Flexbox. I've also added media queries to make the project mobile responsive. Any improvements I could make to this project (e.g. JavaScript for functionality or CSS animations) I will likely leave for my actual portfolio.
